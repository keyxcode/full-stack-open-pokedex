- Some common tools for linting, testing, and building TypeScript projects are:

  - Cicada: a modern CI/CD engine that lets you write your pipelines in TypeScript.
  - Semaphore: a cloud-based CI/CD service that supports Node.js and TypeScript projects.
  - tsc: the TypeScript compiler that can be run from the command line to compile TypeScript files to JavaScript.

- Some alternatives to Jenkins and GitHub Actions for CI are:

  - CircleCI: a cloud-based CI/CD platform that integrates with GitHub and offers parallel jobs, test execution, and container support.
  - Azure Pipelines: a cloud-based CI/CD service that supports multiple languages and platforms, including TypeScript, and integrates with GitHub and Azure DevOps.
  - GitLab CI: a part of GitLab that provides a continuous integration service with a YAML-based configuration file and a web interface.
  - Cicada: a modern CI/CD engine that lets you write your pipelines in TypeScript and run them in the cloud or locally.
  - Buildkite: a CI/CD tool that combines the power of your own build infrastructure with a web-based interface and integrations with GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.

- The choice between a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment for a TypeScript CI pipeline depends on various factors, such as:
  - Infrastructure management: self-hosted CI requires more responsibility for maintaining and scaling the underlying systems, while cloud-based CI delegates most of the work to an external provider.
  - Security: self-hosted CI offers more control over the access and protection of your code and data, while cloud-based CI relies on the provider’s security measures and compliance.
  - Flexibility: self-hosted CI allows more customization and integration with various services and tools, while cloud-based CI may have some limitations or constraints depending on the provider’s features and capabilities.
  - Cost: self-hosted CI involves more capital investment and operational expenses, while cloud-based CI typically charges based on usage or service tiers.
